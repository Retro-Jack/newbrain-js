"""Build deck-empty.webp: the deck with no cassette, showing the bay.

    python3 art/make-deck-empty.py

Inputs are both in the repository, so this reproduces without anything from
outside it:

    art/src/QFX-boombox-empty-bay.png   the render with an empty bay, 1930x815
    art/deck.webp                       the deck we already ship, 1200x507

The problem this solves is that the two are not the same picture. The source
render is still the original purple; the deck we ship has been graded to a
warm near-monochrome. Rather than guess at that grade, it is measured: the
plastic frame around the bay appears in both, untouched, so binning the
source's luminance against the shipped deck's channels over that frame gives
three curves that ARE the grade, whatever it was made of. The curves go on
the bay, and the bay goes in.

Two things worth not undoing.

The bay is composited into deck.webp rather than re-exported from the full
resolution master. deck.webp is that master downscaled and THEN embossed with
the transport symbols on its buttons -- measured, the two differ by a mean of
5.2 and all of it is in the top row. Re-exporting would quietly drop the
symbols. This way every pixel outside the bay is the shipped file's own.

The grade is fitted against a strip of frame held out of the fit, and the
residual is printed. If that number climbs, the curves have stopped
describing the grade and the bay will not match the deck around it.

Note for anyone lining things up: this render puts the spindles 372px apart
at y=440 in master coordinates, while the cassette's hubs in deck.webp are
308 apart at y=457. The two renders disagree. It does not matter today --
the reel animation only runs when a tape is loaded, so the two are never on
screen together -- but do not take the spindles here as the hub positions.
Those are in regions.json.

    disc that stops inside the halo leaves its own rim showing, which is what
